Project setup:

express-server:
 - Navigate to the express-server folder and run "npm run dev" command
 - run "npm i" command
 - To access the server info go to http://localhost:7777
 - You need MongoDB Compass (install if you do not have it) and connect to mongodb://localhost:27017

react-app:
 - Navigate to the "react-app/my-app" folder
 - run "npm i" command
 - run "npm start" command
 - page should automatically load when app compiles, if not you can access the app at "http://localhost:3000"

Note, you might need to refresh the page once, just in case!
